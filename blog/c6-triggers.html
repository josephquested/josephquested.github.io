        <p><strong>How did the trigger training exercises feel/Did you notice any responses in yourself?</strong> <br>
        I have definitely been more aware of feeling trigger moments when they happen to me, (and others) since reading this chapter. I notice them most when I'm interacting with my children in moments of tension. My son, Dexter, is often extremely invested in things being exactly the way he wants them to be, and he can enter periods of blind rage when he realises that things aren't going his way. These are moments when we both could benefit from some trigger training exercises. He is a little young to practice the techniques currently, but I have definitely been taking them on board.</p>

        <p>I find taking a moment to stop and breathe is incredibly useful. The hard part is catching yourself before the anger washes over your brain. There are times when I will be caught unawares by frustration; especially in the evening, brushing Dexter's teeth. Every single night it is a bitter battle. Every night, without fail, he screams and says that I am not allowed to help him brush his teeth. I try to explain to him that he just isn't good enough with the brush yet to get everywhere he needs to, and that I need to help him finish brushing right at the end. Every single night we battle over this for about ten minutes, and every night eventually he succumbs and lets me brush his teeth. (But not before much shouting and crying). It is, and I can't overstate this enough, IMMENSELY frustrating to have the same argument with the same outcome every night.</p>

        <p>I get angry. The anger never actually manifests itself in any way; I never resort to non-consensual brushing. But sometimes that feeling of like, <em>Oh My God Just Give Me The Fucking Brush Already Its Going To Happen Eventually It Happens Every Night Just Give Me The Fucking Brush This Is SO POINTLESS GIVE ME THE FUCKING BRUSH</em> overwhelms me all at once. My mind becomes a swarm of angry, toothbrush themed wasps. At that moment I stop, and breathe, and resume my politely asking him to let me brush his teeth, and eventually he gives in. So, breathing, reflecting, responding. It all helps, I just wish HE would read Search Inside Yourself already. Because he could definitely use some trigger training.</p>

        <p><strong>What emotion do you want to befriend?</strong><br>
        Probably anxiety. Even though the frustration I described above is difficult, I am naturally not an angry or frustrated person. I have, however, gone through periods where my life and happiness are dictated by anxiety and fear. Although this has improved significantly, I think I still struggle from time to time with social and phobic anxieties. I'm sure mindfulness training could be of great help here, but so far I've found the best technique is simply focusing on the big picture.</p>

        <p>In times of anxiety or panic, I try to remind myself that suffering is always a temporal adversary. I call it the Scope Technique. It goes like this:</p>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> Will this still be a problem for me in one year? No.<br>
        <strong>2.</strong> Will this still be a problem for me in one month? ..No.<br>
        <strong>3.</strong> Will this still be a problem for me in one week? ...No.<br>
        <strong>4.</strong> Will this still be a problem for me in one day? .....No.<br>
        <strong>5.</strong> Will this still be a problem for me in one hour? .....Probably not.<br>
        <strong>6.</strong> Can you survive an unpleasant hour? Yes.</p>

        <p>I encourage you to give it a try in times of turmoil.<br>-xx JQ</p>
