      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3> 
      <p>Grid based design is a technique to create and manage easy, scalable web content. The basic premise involves creating 12 classes in HTML, titled col-1, col-2 etc. These columns take up a certain percentage of the screen, regardless of the screen size. By doing this, you can easily slot content into “boxes” on the grid by defining them as a certain size class. For example, if you want something that will take up exactly half of your screen, regardless of web browsing platform, you would set it within a size class of &lt;div class=“col-6”&gt;. And, because in your CSS document you have specified that .col-6 has a width: element of 50%, the content within your &lt;div&gt; will scale accordingly.</p>   
      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3> 
      <p>Come on man, we don’t really need to have this conversation again, do we? Everything is happening on a phone or tablet these days, and soon we’ll be staring at webpages through our magic virtual reality contact lenses or whatever. It just makes sense to design webpages (and most things), in such a way as they are future proof, and can adapt intelligently as apposed to breaking every few years. </p> 
      <h3>Semantic Structure?</h3>  
      <p>I assume this just means some reflections on the semantic structure of writing CSS? I mean, like everything, my grasp of the semantics of CSS are pretty awful at the moment, because I’m a total beginner. <a href="http://robdodson.me/css-semantics">This</a> article has some good insights into CSS semantics that could do a much better job of articulating this than I can. </p>
      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</h3> 
      <p>I think I am starting to get a tiny hint at how fun web design might be one you actually know what the hell you’re doing. Every now and then when I get a selector to do exactly what I want, I feel that tiny spark that implies how much I could do if only I wasn’t completely inexperienced. So, that’s something to look forward to. <br> — xx JQ
