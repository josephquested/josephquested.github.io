      <h2>Reflections on Campfire Talk</h2>
      <h3>What's your take on the EDA experience / What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>I think it is exactly the way higher education should be approached. The problem with the current model of tertiary education is that people are going into it with that exact “restaurant” mindset described in the video. You pay your money, are told the series of facts you need to learn for an exam, memorise them, take the exam, pass, then apply for jobs. (And probably get told, “Sorry, a bachelors degree isn’t really worth anything anymore, come back when you have a masters”). This idea of approaching learning based on a “hunger” as mentioned in the video is exactly how universities used to work. When higher education was first invented as a concept, you didn’t go there to try increase your employability. You went because you were HUNGRY for knowledge, and you need to be surrounded by like-minded people. I think environments like EDA are going to revive that lost mentality.</p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>Very well; I have the hunger. </p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>Not much, I have friends who went through EDA, and I had a pretty good understanding of what was in store. I was pleasantly surprised by just how much EE content there is though, I thought the ratio of content would be more heavily weighted towards coding. This seems like a pretty good balance, and I’m sure more hardcore programming modules are still to come. </p>
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      </h3>
      <p>Coming from weird, ultra liberal schools as I have, it isn’t an entirely unfamiliar environment. I was homeschooled, then went to Discovery 1 and Unlimited. They are a pair of freaky leftwing emotional learning and independent project based schools. I think I am entering fairly familiar territory... Albeit much more time and work intensive than I am accustomed to, but I am looking forward to throwing myself into that. <br>
