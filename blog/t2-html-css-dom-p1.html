      <h2> Technical Blog </h2>
      <h3>From the websites you visited in the practice assignment, create a list of design and structural features you liked that you may want to use in your designs next week:</h3>


      <p>I really liked the websites with clean, elegant design. I am typically not a big fan of loud designs or cluttered options. There is definitely a place for complicated and technical website design, but personally I prefer something more minimal. A white, brown grey colour scheme, with some stark red or blue for contrast.</p>  

      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>

      <p>There are many common analogies used to understand HTML and CSS; mostly people picture trees or books.  
      Instead of this, let’s imagine for a minute, a giraffe covered in tattoos.  
      In this analogy, the giraffe is a website. The giraffe’s sick tattoos are arranged in various styles and locations, including but not limited to, a peace sign tramp stamp. The way in which these tattoos are arranged, and the words/pictures in the tattoos, are called HTML. HTML is a special language with which we describe how we are going to tattoo this giraffe, and what the tattoos are going to say/do.</p>

      <p>While we’re looking at this giraffe, we’re going to look at it from the very tip of its weird little horns, all the way down to its big toenails. (In that order). This giraffe, like most, starts with a head. The head of this giraffe, much like the &lt;head&gt; of an HTML document, contains various elements that (while you can’t necessarily see them) are important to keep everything working smoothly. It is important to note that, unlike giraffes, HTML does not have a &lt;neck&gt; element.</p> 

      <p>Next we come to the &lt;body&gt; of the giraffe, this is where the real meat of the animal is. Here we can see the text on her various tattoos, and the ways in which she has had them styled. This is an important distinction: HTML should refer only to the CONTENT of the tattoos, i.e: the words “Forever Young”, or various Bob Marley lyrics. The styling of these tattoos is controlled by a different language, known as CSS. CSS is used to make various rules about the ways in which the giraffes tattoos are displayed. i.e: All tattoos that are paragraphs of text &lt;p&gt;, or tattoos that conform to various classes, &lt;div class=“bob marley lyrics”&gt;, can be displayed in specific ways.</p>  

      <p>Let’s imagine for a second that we have a somewhat magical giraffe on our hands here. If we were to walk up to her, we could click on the section of her &lt;body&gt; that said &lt;div class=“bob marley lyrics”&gt; and it would, (like magic), expand and show us all the various bob marley lyric related content within the giraffe. Now imagine that, looking down the neck of the majestic beast, there were an ever expanding list of nested little sections. We could look at these sections and organise them, or exploit their structure to better understand the inner workings of the giraffe. This is called a DOM. It is essentially a map of information, and the ways in which that information is stored in various containers.</p>  

      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3> 

      <p>To boxify a website, one might imagine it as a series of content boxes of certain dimensions. By thinking of it this way, you can more easily get a sense for how you might go about laying out a new website, or to better understand the design of a pre-existing website.</p>  

      <h3>What is the box model? </h3>
      <p>The box model helps you to position various elements on a website, and controls their sizes relative to the boxes around them. The box model has four components. all of which are measured in pixels:</p>
      <p>Content: This, as implied by the word “content”, houses the actual content for the element. Maybe the text, or an image.<br> Padding: The region around the main content of an element.<br> Border: The border around the padding of an element.<br>Margin: The invisible area after the border, it helps to space elements from each other with the appropriate buffer zones. <br> — xx JQ
