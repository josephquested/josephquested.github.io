        <p><strong>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important:</strong> <br>
        Time was, everyone looked at websites exclusively on their desktop computers. It was a simpler time in some ways (although much, MUCH more complicated in other ways) chiefly because screens were all more or less the same size. This meant that, when designing a webpage, you could design it once and be confident that all users would see basically the same thing. These days, however, what with tablets and smartphones and whatever else, there is a large variety of screen sizes that one must take into account when designing a website. Responsive design means building your website (via computer code) in such a way as it can intelligently size itself, based on the size of the device viewing it. </p>

        <p><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important:</strong><br>
        Generally speaking, it is much easier to start with something small and make it larger than the other way around. IE: A novel. If you were to write a single sentence, you could gradually flesh it out, expanding the story and characters piece by piece, until you eventually had a full length book. If I’m not mistaken, in writing this is called the Snowflake Method. It is much harder though, to do the reverse. Say you had a full length book, and you were asked to distil it down into a single sentence... That is much harder to do. You have to ask yourself, “What are the truly important aspects here? I can’t see the forest for the trees!”. This is the principle behind mobile first design: It is easier to design a minimal, essential version of your website (one that can be viewed on a phone-sized screen), and then gradually expand flesh out the content to fix larger sized screens. </p>

        <p><strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons:</strong><br>
        Frameworks in the context of CSS refer to a little set of pre-prepared rules that you can apply to your website code to help with various things. Using frameworks can offer a wide variety of advantages, but above all they are a time saver. Instead of having to write a whole bunch of code to define your own rules for building the structure of a website, a framework can take all that work off your hands by simply containing the code straight out of the box. The downsides are fairly limited, potentially a framework might contain rules that don’t jive with your particular website or design, but you could always rewrite those rules yourself.</p>

        <p><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it:</strong><br>
        A wireframe is a basic visual outline of a webpage or design. For example, you might sketch out a few simple drawings of what your website will look like, with notes indicating what certain buttons do, or where various links might lead. Wireframes can also be working prototypes, but with all the actual functionality stripped away. When I was designing iPhone apps, I used a website called proto.io to design interactive wireframes of my app before coding it. Proto.io provides wireframing software that you can use to make pretend versions of real products. They don’t actually have the functionality of the final product, but you can still click on the buttons and get a sense of the feel of an app before you have coded it. A very, very shit wireframe might look like this: 
        </p>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="/images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="one-half column">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="/images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg">
            </div>  
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="one-half column">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="/images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg">
            </div>
          <div class="one-half column">
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="/images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg">
            </div>  
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><br><strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why:</strong><br>
          Definitely the images have given me the most trouble so far. I don't fully understand the logic behind the column system when it comes to mobile screen sizes. The above images are both set as class="one-half column" divs, with a dynamic sizes that allows them to grow or shrink with the screen. But once shrunk down to a mobile format, it seems like skeleton automatically collapses all columns down into individual rows, which is actually not what I want. But I'm sure I'll get it with practice. <br>
          <em>(*Note, I have now fixed this issue by using the built in skeleton class u-max-full-width)</em></p>
          <p><strong>The accessibility features you included in your site:</strong><br>
          In addition to role="" elements, I have stuck to the classic rules of blue links, basic navigation, and generally just following web conventions. </p>
