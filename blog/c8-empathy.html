          <p><strong>Try the 'Just Like Me' and 'Loving Kindness' practices. How did you feel?</strong></p>
          <p>I have a somewhat difficult time practising this form of meditation. I think there are a couple reasons for this: Firstly, at this is a somewhat trivial thing that I should probably just get over, but I find reciting mantras to be a really uncomfortable thing. This spawns from a few personal experiences. I used to work for a Hare Krishna organisation, and it was expected of me that I would chant while performing many actions. I had to chant the Krishna mantra while I cooked all the food at their restaurant. There was something about being in this slightly uncomfortable setting, and being forced to perform a mantra over and over again that felt kind of...indoctrinate-y. Another experience I had was when I was a child and I suffered from pretty severe anxiety issues, I went to a weirdo-hippie therapist who had me tap my chest and chant, "I love and respect myself, I love and respect myself" over and over. That also made me feel kind of uncomfortable and I didn't find it helpful, it just made me feel silly. So, any situation in which I have to repeat a phrase over and over again feels kind of...uneasy, to me.</p>
          <p><strong>Try the 'Traditional Practice of Loving Kindness' - Did you prefer this technique?</strong></p>
          <p>Similar situation to just like me, I found the chanting a little unnerving. Although I think I did prefer the mantra here a little more, because it is shorter and very positive. I did have a bit of trouble picturing people I dislike, not because I felt all encompassing hostility, but mostly just for lack of a subject. I mean, there are I guess some people in my life that I find difficult to interact with, but genuinely for the most part I like and appreciate everyone that I know, more or less.</p> 
          <p><strong>Have you been in a situation in which Empathetic Listening could have improved a conversation? Or, describe a situation where empathetic listening practices worked well:</strong></p>
          <p>This is a bit of a trick question, because empathic listening can basically improve every conversation! I can't really think of an example where it would be detrimental to you to have empathy for the person you are speaking with. There are some scenarios in which I can imagine it mighty be EASIER to not empathise. Like saying "no" to a homeless person begging for spare change, certainly a lack of empathy in that situation would be less taxing emotionally, and you would feel less guilt, but I think it would be hard to argue that is a good thing. The easier option isn't always the best option.</p>
          <p><strong>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise":</strong></p>
          <p>I have actually been reading Carol Dweck's book Mindset on and off since I started this course. I'm only 60% through (according to my little kindle dots), but I think it has definitely improved me and the way that I think about accomplishment/failure. The concept of "person praise" and "process praise" is a big focus in the book. Without getting into it too deeply, the idea is that telling somebody they "did good work", as opposed to saying they are a "good worker" can make a big difference on their mindset and understanding of themselves. Praising somebody on their work puts the emphasis on earned accomplishment, as opposed to innate qualities. According to Dweck (and other social science researchers) being praised for earned accomplishments ("you did good work") puts you into a "growth mindset" and increases your motivation to continue to grow and improve. Where as praising innate qualities ("you are a good worker") puts you in a "fixed mindset" and can make people feel pressure to continue performing at their assumed skill level.
