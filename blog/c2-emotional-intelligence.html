      <h2> Search Inside Yourself, Chapter Four </h2>
      <p>The chapter begins by talking about clarity and emotional awareness. These two qualities, especially emotional awareness, really are at the heart of why mindfulness meditation is a useful practice I think. Giving yourself some tools and the time to observe your emotions is such an important habit to get into. Meng talks about the practical applications of this awareness, like not screaming at your boss, but it obviously goes much deeper than that. While it’s true that emotional awareness acts as the “gate” that keeps your emotions from spilling out onto other people, I think more importantly it keeps your emotions from running the show inside your own mind. If you don’t have a good understanding of the emotions you are experiencing, you are much more likely to have them overwhelm you and dictate undesirable actions. This was well articulated with the flagpole metaphor. The idea that mindfulness and emotional awareness are the pole that keeps your mind from flying away in times of great tumult. </p>
      <p>This chapter also introduces the concept of body scanning. While I have done body scanning a little in the past, I haven’t practiced it recently. I find it to be an interesting but somewhat frustrating experience. Personally I loath owning a physical body. I would, if given the choice, forego it entirely for some sort of cloud-based, bodiless consciousness. But, given that isn’t quite possible yet, I am stuck within this mortal coil. Hence my frustration with body scanning, it makes me ever so aware of my body and its physical failings and dependencies. I don’t have any meditation journals from body scans I have done, but I will include here a few entries from the period in which I was reading this chapter of search inside yourself:</p> 
      <p>2/12/15 7.50am <br> 10 minutes. One of the best meditations I've had so far. It felt shorter than usual. I listened to a podcast with Sam Harris on meditation while I was running, and it talked about the importance of being interested in and noticing things, rather than judging them. Search inside yourself covers this a lot as well, but I had never really put it into practice until today. Whenever I would lose focus and thoughts would enter my mind, I simply looked at them and tried to understand where they had come from and why they were there. The act of noticing them was enough to instantly make them disappear. It was as if as soon as I looked at them they went poof. I didn't maintain a particularly strong focus on my breath, but the whole process was much more calming than usual, because I didn't feel that pressure to perform well. It didn't feel like failure when I noticed I wasn't mindful of my breath, it just felt like a thing that was currently happening, and then my breath was happening again. I need to start meditating for longer, but it's just really hard to find the time in the mornings. I might try find some time during the day that I can practice.</p>  
      <p>3/12/15 7.20am <br> Pretty low focus today, I could hear the office on television in the background which kept drawing my attention. I don't know whether stuff like that is good, because it trains you to be focused despite distraction, or whether when you're starting out it's easier to practice in a quiet environment. Either way, I had a nice time. I just let my thoughts come and go.</p>  
      <p>4/12/15 7.20am <br> Moderate levels of focus. I went downstairs to meditate to get away from some of the distractions upstairs, at first I tried sitting, but it just didn't work for me so I went back to corpse pose and I felt much more relaxed and capable.</p>  
      <p>5/12/15 7.00am <br> 10 minutes. My mind just kind of wandered all over the show today, but it was a nice wander. I spent a little bit of the time with my breath but also was thinking about a lot of other stuff. I think I need to get a little bit stricter with myself on focusing on the breath. My last few meditations have become much more just like periods of relaxation than mindfulness.<br> — xx JQ
