        <p><strong>Which concepts did you find most difficult?</strong></p>
        <p>Probably getting my head around recursive functions. More broadly, I generally struggled on algorithmic work with a heavier focus on mathematical abilities. Mathematics are really not my strong suit.</p>
        <p><strong>Which skills/concepts do you feel still confused by? (Don't worry, we don't expect you to have mastered everything!)</strong></p>
        <p>Probably, again, recursion. I can understand the concept, and given a specific example I can work my way through it and extract the logic, but I would say I still have almost zero ability to write an elegant recursive function. This also feeds into my hesitations around accessing properties within nested objects. I am confident going one or two layers down into a nested array, but beyond that things get a little murky in my mind. Similarly, I am still shakey on the syntax and implementation of jquery, but that's just for lack of experience at this point. I haven't used it much at all.</p>
        <p><strong>Which skills/concepts do you feel you understand best?</strong></p>
        <p>Over the last year I have done a lot of basic programming in UnityScript, it's essentially a very close sibling of JavaScript, made for coding games in the Unity Engine. So the fundamental syntax and processes of JavaScript are quite familiar to me at this point. I still thought of myself as having almost no understanding of programming concepts, but while working through the material of the last 8 weeks I realised that, (while I am still an extreme beginner), the work in UnityScript I have done over the last year was extremely useful.</p>
        <p><strong>Which aspects of web development so far do you enjoy the most?</strong></p>
        <p>I really enjoy the feeling of making tangible progress on a project. It’s super satisfying to work on a function for ages, finally get it working, and then see the success reflected on the page visually. I think I’m also really excited because, in brief glimpses, I can see how great it would feel to actually be a competent programmer. I also enjoy that web development involves utilising several different languages, it lets you feel like you’re stretching several muscles at once.
