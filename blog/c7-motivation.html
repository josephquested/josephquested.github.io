          <p><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></p>
          <p>
          I find that generally I don't have much trouble drumming up pleasure, passion and purpose in my life. I take pleasure fairly easily, and as the amount of free time I have in my life dwindles down and down, I take more pleasure in brief moments of respite and joy. 
          Passion, I have a little more trouble with. I have been known to be pretty apathetic. People have told me, and it is also a quality I identify in myself. While it is definitely a character flaw, it's pretty low on my list of problems. I find that apathy, while it definitely has it's downsides, can also make life easier in some situations. It knocks a little bit of joy off your highs, but it also mediates and limits your lows. Purpose is truly the mastermind behind the whole thing, and luckily I don't have much trouble feeling a sense of purpose. Having children definitely made it easier to feel purpose. They are a great motivator in many ways in life. Even simple stuff like, I no longer have the option to sleep in, ever, on any day. And while having to get up at 6am can be taxing in some ways, it also forces purpose into my days in a very unavoidable way.
          </p>
          <p><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</p>
          <p>What are your core values?</strong></p>
          <p>I think resting at my centre is a (potentially slightly concerning) belief that everybody's core value should essentially be their own happiness. While that sounds like selfishness, I like to think of it like emotional economics. Economics is the allocation of scarce resources. And, generally speaking, the people who are best suited to the job of allocating scarce resources are the ones who own and understand those resources. So by extension, I believe that all people are responsible for their own happiness and well being. I believe that everyone's personal happiness should be their prime core value, so long as it doesn't come at the expense of anyone elses, obviously.  </p>

          <p><strong>What do you stand for?</strong></p>
          <p>More than anything, I think probably the right for people to make their own decisions and live their lives by free and fair terms.</p>

          <p><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></p>
          <p>I love the metaphor of happiness as a deep ocean. "The surface might be choppy, but the bottom is always calm". I think that's a very apt picture of the way I want my psyche to behave. I found the meditation exercise a little challenging, because I always find it hard to recall instances of specific emotions. Maybe as a result of the apathy I mentioned earlier, I don't feel a very strong pull in either direction during successes or failure. I mean, of course I enjoy success and don't treasure failure, but in terms of specific instances in which they occurred in volume, I couldn't really recall anything of note. </p>
          <strong><p>Any other musings?</strong></p>
          <p>I like the idea of meditating of failures, I think it is probably a really good way to psychologically massage out any lingering sadnesses or regrets that might lurk after a failure. </p>
