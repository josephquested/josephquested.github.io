          <p><strong>1. Got blocked on a simple problem:</strong></p>
          <p>What was the problem?<br>
          I had a lot of trouble initially getting my bio to append to the resume HTML in the recent audacity challenge. 
           What problem solving techniques did you use?
          I tried console.logging various inputs and variables that were involved in the process, trying to figure out what was being assigned what and when.
           How did you feel throughout the process?
          Somewhat frustrated, definitely. But there is something very satisfying about being stuck on something for a long time and then having the answer dawn on you all at once. That’s why old puzzle adventure games like monkey’s island were so enjoyable. You work away at something over and over, it’s almost like the longer it takes to get the answer, the more satisfying the answer is when it finally comes.</p>
          <p>What did you learn?<br>
          I learned that I was using jQuery selectors wrong, and that I was having trouble with the basic concepts of accessing properties of objects nested within arrays. I am definitely improving my mental picture of nested objects, reading eloquent javascript is helping a lot.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</strong></p>
          <p>What was the problem?<br>
          I was having trouble in my javascript racer game getting the updatePosition function to know which racer I was talking about. 
           What problem solving techniques did you use?
          Heaps of console.logging, testing to see where various variables were being declared and what their values were when they were being used as arguments. 
           How did you feel throughout the process?
          I got it working pretty early on, but it definitely wasn’t an elegant system. There is a certain bitter-sweet satisfaction to be gained when you finally get something going, but you know that you’ve done it in a really heavy-handed or messy way. It definitely feels good to get something working, then come back and refine the system later once. Because we’re all at this stage of learning so many new concepts so quickly, we are all improving at a really rapid rate. So it is almost guaranteed that the next time you look back on code you wrote a week ago, you are now better equipped to solve the problem elegantly.</p>
          <p>What did you learn?<br>
          I learned that building “pure functions” is not always possible or necessary, but “pure-er” or “pure-ish” functions should always be at least an objective to keep in mind.</p>
          <p><strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></p>
          <p>Pseudocode: I do pseudocode a little, often I drive in and start tackling a problem too quickly (as I think a lot of new and inexperienced programmers tend to), and I need to force myself more to pseudocode before I start trying to solve any of the problems with real code.<br><br>
          Rubber ducky method: I generally don’t use this method much, but I definitely see the value in it. While I don’t (but probably should) actually talk through things out loud, I definitely am doing it in my mind a lot.<br><br>
          Reading error messages: Depending on the language, error messages can be pretty inscrutable. I first started learning to code in Swift, which gives very generous and understanding error messages a lot of the time. Since switching over to javascript, I have definitely found the messages a little less transparent, but still really useful from time to time.<br><br>
          Console.logging: I am obsessed with console.logging. I do it all the time, it is probably my main method of problem solving.<br><br>
          Googling: Also, a very very big resource for me. Googling is obviously especially useful in combination with error messages. Slack overflow is my best friend. <br><br>
          Asking your peers for help: Up until recently, I didn’t have any peers physically near me. I think I have asked for advice on slack once or twice before. But generally I have opted for asking google first, and got the answer before needing to go to my peers. Now that Ashley and I are in the same place though, we have definitely been using each other as recourses more often. <br><br>
          Asking coaches for help: The coaches helped me a lot slightly earlier on in the course, getting my VM working and with the linux side of things. Over the last few sprints I haven’t needed them as much, as with my peers, typically I go to google and find the answer first. <br><br>
          Improving your process with reflection: I do reflection a lot in my personal life, I have a daily reflection practice in the evening. I find myself a little worse at reflecting on my dev academy work, generally because my memory recall of specific problems I’ve faced isn’t very strong. I think I should be more diligent about journalling problems/situations as they happen, so when I’m reflecting I can look back over stuff that has happened. Journals are much more reliable than my memory.</p>
          <p><strong>Explain to your non-tech friend
          Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</strong></p>

          <p>.map(): In javascript you have something called an array, it is, as the name implies, an array of various objects or values. .map() is a little computer function that sweeps over all the things contained in an array, and performs another function on them. For example, I might have an array of numbers that looked like this: var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; And I might want to multiply them all by 10; I could do this with the .map() function by saying: var newNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) { return number * 10}); And this little bit of code would give me a new array, full of my old numbers, multiplied by ten.<br><br>
          .filter(): Filter does a similar thing to map, it sweeps over all the objects in an array and runs a function on them, but instead of giving me a new array with new versions of the old objects (like .map();), it gives me a new array of items that passed a little test that I specify. I might want to test which numbers in my numbers array are above 3. I could do that by saying var bigNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) { return number > 3 }); And then I would have a new array, with the numbers 4 and 5.<br><br>
          .reduce(): Reduce is the most complicated of these methods so far, it takes an array and smooches everything in it down into one value. I could use it to take all the numbers in my numbers array, and reduce them all down into a single number. It would look a little but like var total = numbers.reduce(previousValue, currentValue, index, numbers); The “arguments” that I’m giving this function are a little tricky to explain. Basically what I’m saying is, “Every time you get to a new number in the array, add the previousValue to the currentValue, and keep going until there are no more objects in the numbers array”.</p>
          <p><strong>Have a go at explaining how recursion compares to iteration (In your own words)</strong></p>
          <p>Recursion is definitely one of the concepts I am having the most trouble with at the moment. Essentially it is a very cunning way of structuring your functions, often allowing an extremely small amount of code to perform very complicated tasks. Iterative functions are easier to understand because generally you can see everything that is going to happen laid out there in front of you. If you have a for loop that iterates over an array, you know that for every item in this array, this particular function will be performed. It is fairly straightforward. Recursive functions on the other hand, can return similar results, but in sometimes much more elegant ways by calling themselves over and over. Instead of saying, “For every item in an array, do ____” (Iterative), the function might sound more like “If I haven’t yet achieved the result I want, I am going to try again and again and again until I have either achieved it, or realised that I can’t”.
