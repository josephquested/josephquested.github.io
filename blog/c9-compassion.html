        <p><strong>Read or watch chapter 8 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:
        What are your thoughts about the compassion training?</strong></p>
        <p>I really love the idea of thinking about yourself as a filter for negative emotions. It is described as filtering your emotional junk, which is kind of the perfect description. Visualising the junk as a dark, noxious cloud is a pretty powerful image. The part I found difficult was being able to visualise the process fast enough to keep up with my breath. I’m sure you can speed up the process with practice, but just the act of picturing the purification of gunk took quite a bit of time and mental energy. Trying to squeeze all that visualisation into the space between breathes felt like a bit of a rush-job.</p>
        <p><strong>Give a short summary of each of the components of the SCARF model of social behaviour</strong></p>
        <p>Status: For some people, status is really their key motivator in all situations. The boss I had at my last job was utterly obsessed with status. There were many factors that contributed to his status-mania, not to mention his cultural background. He is Chinese and talked frequently about the asian concept of “Face”. Face is one of the driving social forces in China, and it revolves entirely around the idea of social status and your rank in the pecking order. Any socially clumsy or unbecoming action could result in the loss of Face, and by extension the loss of status in interpersonal relationships or social structures. <br><br>
        Certainty: Probably the most straightforward component of the SCARF model. Simply, if you are uncertain of your role or place in life, whatever the circumstance may be, it is an unsettling and uncomfortable feeling. Having a degree of certainty about the role you play gives you a feeling of purpose and belonging. <br><br>
        Autonomy: For me personally, autonomy is the most important of the SCARF components. I couldn’t care less about status, but it is very important for me to feel like I have some freedom over my actions and situation. I think this is as a result of my upbringing, I was homeschooled, and then went through several very self directed learning establishments. If I feel like I am just being given blind instruction, and not allowed any autonomy within the process, the whole thing seems kind of pointless to me.<br><br> 
        Relatedness: Simply refers to your relationship with your collaborators (or anti-collaborators!) as their friends or foes. As pretty much anyone can attest, it is a much nicer feeling to be surrounded by trusted, safe company. <br><br>
        Fairness: Fairness is a really murky topic I think. As soon as you are imposing some sort of moral or ethical judgement as to what Is or Is Not fair, there is an almost unavoidable obstacle in the road ahead: Namely, people draw their moral lines in different places. Sometimes drastically different places. I believe it is almost impossible to impose fairness in a fair way, ironically, because it all depends on who’s subjective definition of fairness you are playing by. That being said, there are generally some common lines in the sand you can draw, and as long as you have reasonable people deciding what is and isn’t fair, a good equilibrium will be met most of the time.</p>
        <p><strong>Difficult conversations and mindful emailing ( or slacking! ) are highly important at EDA. Is there an example in your life where you applied/didn't apply these concepts? How did you feel about it?</strong></p>
        <p>Normally I don’t have much difficulty keeping out of trouble over the internet. A big part of that being that I absolutely refuse to partake in arguments online. I don’t have Facebook, I don’t read youtube comments, and I don’t care about your religious or political views. So simply by having a No Shouting Online policy, much of the drama is automatically taken out of internet communications. I do like the methods search inside yourself recommends for mindful emailing though. Especially useful is the idea of always imagining yourself as the receiver, reading the email, before you send it. By doing this you definitely cut down on the likelihood that you will say something stupid or insensitive. </p>
        <p><strong>** Aside ** Before Pete corrected the waffle page for this blog, I had actually written all the answers to what turned out to be the wrong questions, so I figured I might as well include them here also:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></p>
        <p>In some ways, there is almost no difference between the two. The ability to observe your own mental and physical state is what dictates your relationship to yourself and your actions in life. I think it would be impossible to be truly self aware, or have a realistic picture of yourself, if you didn't have a mindful relationship with your psyche.</p>
        <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></p>
        <p>I've been body scanning for the last couple of weeks since reading this search inside yourself chapter. I find it really useful, especially since my ability to focus on my breath is seemingly crashing dramatically. While I was still really enjoying my morning meditations, they were definitely starting to feel less effective than when I first started. I was struggling to stay with my breath and frequently losing focus. Once I started body scanning, I noticed a really nice improvement in my ability to stay on track. The scans also necessitated that I increase the time that I meditate, I was finding that I often hadn't finished by the time my bell went off.  I've definitely found them to be a really beneficial addition to my practice. </p>
        <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section? --></strong></p>
        <p>I think giving yourself some distance from emotions and describing them as something you have, rather than something you are, is a deceptively powerful idea. It's actually quite a lot like the fixed/growth mindset mentality. You are either telling yourself, "I am angry, I am an angry person" and sort of resigning yourself to the emotion. (The fixed mindset). However if your narrative is more along the lines of "wow, right now I've really got a lot of anger in my body" it feels much more like a transient quality. It is something that you are experiencing now, but soon it will pass and something else will take its place.
