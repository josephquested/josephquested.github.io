        <h2>Reflections on Habit and Timeboxing</h2>
        <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try/what worked for you? </h3>
        <p>I found that a lot of the techniques given in these articles are things that I tend to do, or half-do, already in life. Especially this year I have worked on trying to improve my daily habits. Some of the things mentioned in Fogg’s TEDx talk I have definitely worked into the rhythm of my life. Especially the idea of setting a trigger for yourself after a certain event. After I brush my teeth at night, I put my running clothes next to my bed. After I wake up in the morning, I go running, after I get back from running, I meditate. All of these things chain into each other nicely.
        </p> 
        <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3> 
        <p>What came up again and again in these articles is the idea of starting small. There is really something magical in the MVP model I think. I don’t know if I would agree with the “floss one tooth” technique. I think that is kind of…unnecessarily small, but I definitely agree with the principle. Like starting with two minutes of meditation, or two minutes of writing each day before bed.  
        </p>
        <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        <p>I am going to try find more areas in my life in which I can start small. I design little games a lot, and I definitely have the tendency to get stuck into things long before it is time to do so. Currently I’m making a prototype for a little arcade game where blocks move around a board, and last night I spent an hour drawing these blocks in photoshop instead of coding the AI. A solid grey block would suffice, but I really need the AI to actually make the game playable. It’s just hard to pull yourself away from parts of a project that are fun, to focus on parts that are hard. But, with practice I’ll get there, hopefully. <br>
